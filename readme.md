(In Progress)

Goal: working and trainable [Gato](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06175) implementation for control tasks.


# Setup

## Minari
We rely on [Minari](https://minari.farama.org/) to provide a standard for datasets. However, we are currently testing with MuJoCo locomotion and Atari tasks, which are not included in Minari by default. These datasets are generated by: https://github.com/daniellawson9999/data-tests/
and can be downloaded by: 



```bash
git clone https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Minari.git
cd Minari
pip install -e .

cd ..
python ./gato/data/download_custom_datasets.py
```

# Training
```bash
python train.py --datasets d4rl_halfcheetah-expert-v2 d4rl_hopper-expert-v2 d4rl_walker2d-expert-v2
```

test, with toy size
```bash
python train.py --embed_dim=128 --layers=2 --heads=4 --training_steps=1000 --log_eval_freq=10 --warmup_steps=100 --batch_size=4 -k=256
```
